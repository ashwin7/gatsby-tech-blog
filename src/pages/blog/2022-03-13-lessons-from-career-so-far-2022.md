Some time ago I decided to stop writing. I felt the writing was a bit narcissistic endeavor. 
Isn't it assumptive of us to think that our opinions matter? Or what we are writing is worth knowing?
At the same time, I do understand the dilemma that is if everybody thought that, the transfer of information will stop and our progress will halt.
Maybe, our need to write is a genetic imprint and just part of who we are. Humans have been writing for thousands of years, the earliest form of writing in recorded history dates approximately since the Late Neolithic period 6400BCE.  
I stopped writing because “What will people think?”

I am at a point in life where I have stopped caring about that. I've gone through some major stuff in life, stuff most people are going through right now as well. Like major shit! 
And there were times when the end felt near. But I was able to wade through it. I can write about my experiences. My story could reach that one person who may be needed to hear it. 
And I don't really care if it is narcissistic. 

So here are 5 lessons I learned in my first job that has helped me so far:

1. Master a few things, but learn about most things. 
2. Failure is not always about you, it is just an event that happened.
3. Make meaningful connections. 
4. Search for mentors who inspire you and peers who challenge you.
5. Passion is not an alternative to hard work.
6. If you try to fix things you don't know how to fix, you ruin it. 
7. Be open to changing your opinions.
8. Unsolicited advice, no matter how right it is, is almost always rejected.  
9. A lesson doesn't always have to be something new, it can just be a reminder. Like most of the points in this list.  
10. Not all lessons are good lessons, not all advice is good advice.


There is a lot of unused wisdom lying around inside of ourselves, so share but don't preach.
Until next time...
