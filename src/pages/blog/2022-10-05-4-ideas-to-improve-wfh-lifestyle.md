1. Establish a beginning of the day and end of the day routine to train your brain when your work starts and ends. This could be a 10 minute walk just before and after work to simulate commute. WHen working from it is often  too easy for work and life to blend together but this gives you time to disconnect and is a cooldown exercise.

2. Make a home gym. You don’t have to buy fancy equipments either. Just a corner around house where you do simple body weight exercises every day for few minutes is good enough as well.

3. Buy a really good chair. One of the great things about corporate offices are that they have good ergonomic chairs which we at home usually skimp out of. If you are working from home it is obvious that an ergonomic chair should be utmost priority considering that’s where you’d be sitting for 6-8 hours.

4. Dual Monitor. Having a second screen is a game changer. Increases productivity with least effort.
