1. My personal observation about best time in the day to buy and sell an equity stock:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is my personal observation: Best time to buy equity stocks: Between 3:00-3:30PM.<br>Best time to sell: 10:30 - 11:30AM.<br><br>Works most time for me.

2. Watched Tandav webseries starring Saif Ali Khan and Dimple Kapadia. Didn't like it. It got surrounded by controversies later:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Tandav&quot; webseries felt like such a waste of time. The acting was good, but the story didn&#39;t go anywhere</p>&mdash; Ashwin Saxena (@QM_Ashwin) <a href="https://twitter.com/QM_Ashwin/status/1350546895253327872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

3. Some gyan about learning to pause.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are so busy getting what we like, we forget about liking what we get.<br><br>Got a salary hike? Bought a new car or a home? Next day we stop appreciating that and start running towards something else. <br><br>Learning to take a pause and reflect is essaintial too. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gyanchand?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gyanchand</a></p>&mdash; Ashwin Saxena (@QM_Ashwin) <a href="https://twitter.com/QM_Ashwin/status/1350723303195873284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
